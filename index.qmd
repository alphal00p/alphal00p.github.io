The lack of obvious sign of new physics phenomenon in collider experiments is an opportunity to take a step back and reflect on the amazing theory we have discovered so far: the Standard Model. In particular, we must now strive to make ever more precise predictions so as to hunt for indirect evidence of new physics in small departure from expectations.

For this reason, our collaboration is dedicated to theoretical and algorithmic research for the automated computation of cross-sections in Quantum Field Theories at arbitrary perturbative orders. In particular, we develop a new theoretical framework called *Local Unitarity* (LU) which approaches this problem from an unorthodox way, particularly suited to numerical computations.

$$
\frac{d\sigma}{d\mathcal{O}} \;=\; \sum_{\Gamma\;\in\;\text{graphs}}\;\;
\prod_{i=1}^{n_\text{loop}}\; d^{3}\mathbf{k}_i\;\;
\sum_{c\;\in\;{\text{cuts}}} I^{(\text{LU})}_{\Gamma,c}\;
\delta( \mathcal{O}( c, \mathbf{k}_i ) )
$$

Our research leads to the development of $\alpha\text{Loop}$, a tool for the automated computation of fixed-order cross-sections, for which you will find out more details on our [wiki](https://wiki.alphaloop.ch) and [GitHub](https://github.com/alphal00p/alphaloop).

You can find an easy-to-read first introduction to Local Unitarity in [this proceeding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.15662.pdf), which can then be complemented with further readings found in [our publications](references.qmd).
